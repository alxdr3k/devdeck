# AGENTS.md

See also: `AGENTS.policy.md` — boilerplate-owned cross-cutting agent behaviour rules.
## Working principles

- Think before editing: state assumptions and tradeoffs when ambiguity changes the solution. Ask before unsafe guesses.
- Keep it simple: add only what the request needs. No speculative features, abstractions, configuration, or docs.
- Make surgical changes: touch only relevant files, preserve local style, and clean up only debris introduced by your change.
- Separate planning from execution: record known scope with status, but execute only ready and authorized work.
- Verify goals: turn work into checkable outcomes, run documented checks, and report any validation you could not run.

## Read order

For normal implementation tasks after this boilerplate is copied into a project, read:

1. `docs/context/current-state.md`
2. `docs/04_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` active milestone / track / phase / slice
3. `docs/current/CODE_MAP.md`
4. `docs/current/TESTING.md`
5. `docs/11_CI_CD.md` if changing CI/CD, release, deployment pipeline, or required checks
6. task-relevant source files
7. relevant ADR only if changing architecture or product scope

Do not read archived design docs by default.

## Source of truth

- Code, tests, migrations, and generated schema are authoritative for implemented behavior once implementation exists.
- `docs/context/current-state.md` is the compressed current state.
- `docs/04_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` owns roadmap / status ledger: milestone, track, phase, slice, gate, evidence, and next work.
- `docs/01_PRD.md` owns product scope.
- `docs/02_HLD.md` owns intended high-level design.
- `docs/current/` owns thin implementation-state navigation docs.
- `docs/11_CI_CD.md` owns stack-neutral CI/CD guidance.
- `docs/07_QUESTIONS_REGISTER.md` owns open questions.
- `docs/08_DECISION_REGISTER.md` owns lightweight decisions.
- `docs/adr/` owns major architecture decisions.
- `docs/discovery/` and `docs/design/archive/` are history, not authority.

## When changing code

- If runtime behavior changes, update `docs/current/RUNTIME.md`.
- If roadmap position, slice status, gate status, evidence, or next work changes,
  update `docs/04_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.
- If the active milestone / track / phase / slice changes, update
  `docs/context/current-state.md`.
- If acceptance gate definitions or results change, update
  `docs/06_ACCEPTANCE_TESTS.md`.
- If module/file layout changes, update `docs/current/CODE_MAP.md`.
- If DB/schema/data model changes, update `docs/current/DATA_MODEL.md` and
  re-run the schema generator if one exists, then commit the regenerated
  file under `docs/generated/`.
- If test/lint/typecheck/eval commands change, update `docs/current/TESTING.md`.
- If operational/env/deployment behavior changes, update `docs/current/OPERATIONS.md` or `docs/05_RUNBOOK.md`.
- If CI/CD workflow, required check, branch protection, release, or deployment pipeline behavior changes,
  update `docs/11_CI_CD.md`, `docs/current/TESTING.md`, `docs/current/OPERATIONS.md`, or `docs/05_RUNBOOK.md` as applicable.
- If product scope changes, update `docs/01_PRD.md`.
- If architecture direction changes, create or supersede an ADR.
- Do not rewrite archived design notes for implementation changes.
- If the thin doc you are editing carries a `Last verified against code:
  <SHA> (<date>)` header, update the SHA and date to the current commit
  before pushing.

## Validation

Use commands from `docs/current/TESTING.md`.

Do not invent commands.

If validation cannot be run, report why.

## Extraction tasks

When asked to prepare external knowledge-base extraction (e.g. for a personal
`second-brain`-style vault, team wiki, or other curated knowledge system):

1. Read [`docs/templates/EXTRACTION_TEMPLATE.md`](docs/templates/EXTRACTION_TEMPLATE.md) — it is canonical.
2. Read the relevant retrospective / discovery / Q / DEC / ADR source.
3. Prepare an extraction candidate table with `Kind` and `Action` from the template's allowed values.
4. Distinguish candidate vs promoted — every row is a candidate. Do not claim a candidate has been promoted unless the target knowledge base has accepted it.
5. Do not promote raw transcript, stale drafts, rejected recommendations, or project-only implementation details. List them under `Do not promote` with rationale.
6. `Do not promote` must not be left blank. Use `None — reviewed` only after explicit review.
7. Preserve source anchors (repo / path / commit / PR / ADR / DEC / Q). If unknown, write `anchor missing`. Do not fabricate.
8. Report results as Created / Modified / Promoted / Dropped (omit empty groups).
9. Do not modify the external knowledge base unless explicitly asked. Boilerplate prepares the packet; the target knowledge base owns final placement, schema, and validation.
